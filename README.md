## Contact Form – Formspree (Easy, No Database)

The contact form uses [Formspree](https://formspree.io) — no database setup. Submissions go straight to your email.

### Setup (2 minutes)

1. Go to [formspree.io](https://formspree.io) and sign up (free).
2. Click **New Form** → give it a name (e.g. "Portfolio Contact").
3. Copy your form endpoint (looks like `https://formspree.io/f/xxxxxxxx`).
4. Add to your `.env` file:
   ```
   VITE_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT="https://formspree.io/f/xxxxxxxx"
   ```
5. Restart the dev server. Done!

You’ll receive submissions by email and can view them in the Formspree dashboard. Free tier: 50 submissions/month.
